Text Viewer Manual
==================

Upload this script to a site to view the contents of files. 

Once uploaded access it from your web-browser. Use the "file" variable in the address bar to set the filename.

Example 1: `http://www.example.com/text_viewer.php?file=index.php`  
This will show you the contents of the file index.php in the root directory

Example 2: `http://www.example.com/text_viewer.php?file=path/to/file.html`  
This will show you the contents of the file file.html in the directory "path/to".
